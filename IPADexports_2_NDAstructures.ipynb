    "E.g. a raw Data file containing scores for item level responses, and a Scores file, containing the summary statistics for the collection of item level data. We don't need the registration file, but it might be handy for filtering out batteries that were inappropriately administered.  These two files are linked by PIN and Inst (and Assessment) variables, and must be cleaned a priori to remove subjects that are in one but not the other file.  I.e. the list of unique PINs (ex. HCP0211999_V1) in one file should be exactly the same as the list of unique PINs in the other. For HCP data, we concatenate the exports of all subjects' Score data in to a single file, and the exports of all subjects Raw data into a second file.  Because all other sources of HCP data use 'subject' and 'visit' rather than a PIN which is a concatenation of both, we create these variables (subject and visit) from PIN prior to running this program as well, if not already done in pre-processing\n",
    "\n",
    "The third necessary file is a csv containing the fields that NDA requires in all of their structures \n",
    "e.g. subjectkey (GUID or pseudo-GUID), src_subject_id (e.g. HCP0211999), interview_age (in months), and gender (misnomer for sex assigned at birth).  We refer to this requirements file as the 'Rosetta' or 'Inventory, because it is shared accross all sources of HCP data.  In HCP data, we link the two sources of information via 'subject' and 'visit.' \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, read in the crosswalk file - which will map your vars to NDA after transpose is complete.  I have placed the crosswalk from HCP data.  Any instruments in this crosswalk that are the same as yours (look at 'Inst' column) will work for you provided you haven't renamed your columns.  You will have to add any instruments not present, after obtaining variable maps and templates from the NDA for your particular set of NIH Toolbox Data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that subject and visit are variables we created locally to merge with the data coming from a different local source (REDCap).  They are not variables that are output from the NIH Toolbox app on the Ipads, but are necessary for the merge with the NDA required fields stored elsewhere.\n"
